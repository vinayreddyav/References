### Post Incident Repsonse

- detection: when we first notice that there is a problem (ideally from our monitoring system before a customer notices or complains)
- response: we snap into action, engage our incident response process, attempt to triage the situation and respond with urgency
- remediation: we work to determine the problem and work towards bringing the system or service back to working order
- analysis: after the incident, we attempt to learn from the experience, perhaps determining things we may want to change in the system or our process
- readiness: we make changes based on what we learned that can improve our reliability and the context (processes, etc.) around it.

### Blameless postmortems

- What actions they took at what time.
- What effects they observed.
- What expectations they had.
- What assumptions they made.
- Their understanding of the timeline of events as they occurred.
